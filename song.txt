One day there will be no more pain like an opiate wonderland
No more worry, it will all just end

And all our forward movement will finally cease
The human machine will finally bleed
The human machine will finally cease to be

The grounds will shake and your children will tremble
Soon enough the machine will fall
And we will all crumble
The human machine will finally bleed and cease to be
We'll finally be set free, be set free, be set free
